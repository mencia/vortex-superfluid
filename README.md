## vortex-superfluid

We calculate the ground state of infinite two-component rotating superfluids, for two different
models.

## Software

* Python 3.6

## Repository contents

* Rabi.py

It finds the ground state the model shown in https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.97.043609 (or https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09912).

* spin_spin.py

It finds the ground state of the model shown in section 12.2 in "Boseâ€“Einstein Condensation in Dilute Gases".
